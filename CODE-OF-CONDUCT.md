## CODE OF CONDUCT

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our community strives to:

- __Be friendly and patient__.

- __Be Welcoming__ - We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

- __Be Respectful__ - Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
